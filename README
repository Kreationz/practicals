README for RubyPractice

The files are used as exercises in a course and can be run from wihtin each directory. The Rakefile and rspec_config.rb files keep everything set up for you do this.

If you want to run the files without this, then you'll need to set the path to the file with this require statement at the top of the spec file:

require "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/my_class"

Where 'my_class' is the name of the class needed. If you don't have this, then rspec won't find your file. 

I should also point out that the colour settings will be missing if you do this.
